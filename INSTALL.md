This project is incomplete and requires the user to provide an original Harvest Moon GB ROM.  Name this file `baserom.gb` and place it in the root `harvestmoongb` directory.

To build `harvestmoongb.gb`:

	make

This will take a few seconds the first time you build because it needs to process all of the graphics.

To remove all generated files by the build process:

	make clean

To compare the built `harvestmoongb.gb` to the original ROM:

	make compare


# OS X

In the shell, run:

	xcode-select --install

Then follow the Linux instructions.


# Windows

To build on Windows, install [**Cygwin**](http://cygwin.com/install.html) with the default settings.

Dependencies are downloaded in the installer rather than the command line.
Select the following packages:
* make
* git
* gcc-core

The latest compatible version of **rgbds** is  [**0.3.8**](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds/releases/download/v0.3.8/rgbds-0.3.8-win32.zip). To install, put each of the files in the download in `C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin`.

Then set up the repository. In the **Cygwin terminal**:

	git clone https://github.com/huderlem/harvestmoongb.git
	cd harvestmoongb

To build `harvestmoongb.gb`:

	make
